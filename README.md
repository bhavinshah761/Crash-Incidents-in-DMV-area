# Crash-Incidents-in-DMV-area

This data analytics research is carried out to explore the data and perform analysis on the dataset which can help in drawing meaningful data visualization and insights such as statistics, identifying counties where there are more traffic violations occur, rate at which road mishaps are occurring, culprits involved in the incident, etc.
This data analysis project is carried out on Crash Incidents in the DMV area dataset.
The tools used for this project are Python, R, SQL, Microsoft Excel, Jupyter notebook & R Studio. The libraries used are pandas, numpy, matplotlib, pandasql & seaborn.
Data pre-processing & Data cleaning is done using Python & Excel.
Linear Regression model is used & the count of crash accident cases in the future years are predicted using sklearn library.
Machine learning model (KNN algorithm) has achieved accuracy rate of 69% which showcases the model potential in understanding and forecasting crash incidents.
